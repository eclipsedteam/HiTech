### HiTech is EclipsedTeam's newest skin, based off [Trilated](https://github.com/eclipsedteam/Trilated "Trilated Repository") featuring a, well, high-tech looking design. Keep in mind that right now! The skin is still in a WIP (Work in Progress) state and has not reached a final release yet. But don't worry! You can always grab a beta release! (or pre-release)
